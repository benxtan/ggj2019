by Super Ridiculous

## BUGS

* BUG: Lit up squares under populated homes are in the wrong position. They are shifted to the left by almost the width of the map (Level 3).
* BUG: The dog doesn't always appear when you click

## Features to add

* Show cooldown for the dog

### Infinite version

In Assets/Scripts/Main.cs, set DEBUG_INFINITE_VERSION to true.

This will:

* load Map 2
* set the time limit to infinite (-1)
* put 99 people in the level
